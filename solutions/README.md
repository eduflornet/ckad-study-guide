## 🎯 How to Use Solutions

### During Practice
1. **Attempt first** - Try solving without looking at solutions
2. **Compare approach** - Check if your method matches recommended approach
3. **Learn alternatives** - Study different ways to solve the same problem
4. **Understand reasoning** - Focus on why certain approaches are better

### After Mock Exams
1. **Review incorrect answers** - Understand what went wrong
2. **Study time management** - See how to solve problems faster
3. **Practice alternatives** - Try different kubectl approaches
4. **Note patterns** - Remember common YAML structures

## 🔑 Solution Format

Each solution includes:

### Problem Statement
Clear restatement of the requirements

### Solution Approach
Step-by-step methodology

### kubectl Commands
Exact commands to execute

### YAML Manifests
Complete, working YAML files

### Verification Steps
How to test that the solution works

### Alternative Methods
Different ways to achieve the same result

### Common Mistakes
What students typically get wrong

### Time-Saving Tips
How to solve faster in exam conditions

## 📖 Quick Reference

### Command Patterns
```bash
# Generate template, edit, apply pattern
kubectl create deployment web --image=nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml > deploy.yaml
vim deploy.yaml  # Edit as needed
kubectl apply -f deploy.yaml

# Direct imperative commands
kubectl run pod --image=nginx --restart=Never
kubectl expose deployment web --port=80
kubectl scale deployment web --replicas=3
```

### YAML Editing Tips
```yaml
# Always include these metadata
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
  labels:
    app: my-app    # Critical for selectors
  namespace: default  # Be explicit about namespace

# Common spec patterns
spec:
  containers:
  - name: container-name    # Always name containers
    image: nginx:1.20       # Use specific versions
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80     # Document exposed ports
```

## 🚀 Exam Strategy Insights

### Time Management
- **Easy questions (5-8 min)**: Pod creation, basic services
- **Medium questions (8-12 min)**: Deployments with configs, multi-container pods
- **Hard questions (12-20 min)**: Complex networking, troubleshooting

### Common Question Types
1. **Create and configure** (40%) - Make resources with specific settings
2. **Fix broken resources** (25%) - Debug and repair existing resources
3. **Expose applications** (20%) - Services, Ingress, networking
4. **Scale and update** (15%) - Modify existing deployments

### Success Patterns
- **Use generators** - Don't write YAML from scratch
- **Test frequently** - Verify each step works
- **Read carefully** - Missing details costs points
- **Know the shortcuts** - Faster commands save time

- Final practice: 90%+ (exam ready)

## 🔍 Common Mistakes to Avoid

### YAML Syntax Errors
- Incorrect indentation (use 2 spaces)
- Missing colons after keys
- Wrong list formatting (- vs bullets)
- Mixing tabs and spaces

### Kubernetes Specifics
- Wrong namespace (always check context)
- Selector mismatches (labels != selectors)
- Port confusion (containerPort vs port vs targetPort)
- Resource naming (DNS-1123 subdomain format)

### Exam Mistakes
- Not reading requirements fully
- Creating in wrong namespace
- Forgetting to test solutions
- Running out of time on hard questions
