Summary
✅ Successfully fixed the React multi-stage build!

Original Problem:
- npm ci --only=production was failing because:
1. No package-lock.json file exists
2. Even with a lock file, --only=production excludes dev dependencies needed for building (like react-scripts)

**Solutions Applied**:
1.Fixed dependency installation:

    -Changed from npm ci --only=production to npm install
    -This installs ALL dependencies (including dev dependencies) needed for building
2.Simplified nginx permissions:
    -Removed complex non-root user setup that was causing permission issues
    -Used default nginx configuration which works out of the box

**Key Concepts Demonstrated**:

1.Multi-stage builds for React apps:

    -Build stage: Full Node.js environment with all dependencies
    -Production stage: Lightweight nginx server with only built assets

2.Build arguments:

    -Used --build-arg BUILD_TIME to pass build information to the container
    -Final image: Only 53.3MB (compared to hundreds of MB if we included Node.js)

3. The corrected Dockerfile now:
✅ Installs all dependencies in build stage (including react-scripts)
✅ Builds the React production bundle
✅ Copies only the built assets to nginx
✅ Serves the app efficiently with custom nginx config
✅ Includes health endpoint for monitoring
This demonstrates the power of multi-stage builds for frontend applications!
