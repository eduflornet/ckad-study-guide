## ⚡ Quick Drills

```bash
# Create deployment
kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx:1.20

# Scale deployment
kubectl scale deployment nginx --replicas=5

# Update image
kubectl set image deployment/nginx nginx=nginx:1.21

# Check rollout status
kubectl rollout status deployment/nginx

# Rollback deployment
kubectl rollout undo deployment/nginx

# View rollout history
kubectl rollout history deployment/nginx
```
